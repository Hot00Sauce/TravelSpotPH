      <h2>Bohol</h2>
      <p>Bohol is a province of the Philippines, in the country's Central Visayas region. It
        comprises Bohol Island and
        numerous smaller surrounding islands. Bohol is known for coral reefs and unusual geological formations, notably
        the Chocolate Hills. On the main island, near the town of Carmen, these 1,200 or so symmetrical mounds turn
        cocoa-brown in the dry season, contrasting with the surrounding jungle's greenery.<br>It is the largest province
        in the country in terms of total area of 14,649.73 km². <br>The capital city is Puerto Princesa.</p>

      <h2>Chocolate Hills</h2>
      <p>Without a doubt, Bohol’s most iconic tourist attraction is the Chocolate Hills. This geological wonder made up
        of thousands of conical hills has even made it to the PHP200 bill (currently the rarest banknote in the country)
        along with another Bohol icon, the Philippine tarsier. For a hassle-free experience, the best way to see these
        hills is through Chocolate Hills tours. In this guide, you’ll find everything you need to know to plan your
        visit. The island province of Bohol in the Philippines may be smaller than its Visayan neighbors, Cebu and
        Negros, which are home to some of the top tourist spots in Visayas and most beautiful islands in the
        Philippines, but it doesn't fall short of stunning sights and activities, such as its famous Chocolate Hills.
        Joining Chocolate Hills tours will treat you to a breathtaking view of a thousand beautiful cone-shaped hills
        stretched over 50 square kilometers of land across the towns of Carmen, Batuan, and Sagbayan. This is the
        tourist spot that put Bohol on the map of top tourist destinations in the Philippines, and that has baffled many
        geologists. The majestic Chocolate Hills is one of the Philippines' most popular tourist attractions and is the
        top destination for Bohol tours aside from island hopping in the Philippines. It got its name from its strange
        yet unique formation and rich vegetation that turns into chocolate brown during the dry months, hence, the name.

      <h2>Loboc Cruise</h2>
      <p>The Loboc River Cruise in Loboc town is a significant highlight in most Bohol countryside tours. It usually
        comes inclusive of a generous buffet lunch, or dinner served right on the raft. This floating restaurant also
        has singers and musicians onboard to serenade guests while they enjoy popular Filipino dishes. The river cruise
        starts from Loay Bridge near the Church of San Pedro. Midway through the 1-hour cruise, the raft stops in front
        of a large hut for a short performance by more singers and dancers dressed in traditional baro't saya. The raft
        moves along the river until it reaches a small portion of Busay Falls, from which it maneuvers for the return
        trip.</p>
